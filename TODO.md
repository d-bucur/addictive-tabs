- decent ui

- extract list into component and try it in popup
- ignore extension tabs and maybe others as well
- 
- pages added as soon as tab opens do not have details as they haven't been loaded yet
- more granular updates instead of reloading everything
- better reactive updates on changes
- bindings do not persist between browser reloads as windows change ids

- change root bm folder and edge cases
- drag & drop functionality
- possibility to change names of groups and auto window naming like TBP

- move ownership of groups to background script so updated can happen in the bg
- auto sync (needs details)
- 
- abstract bookmarks as persist method, provide other storage types
- add sidebar view?
- group emoticon?
